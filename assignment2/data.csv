Reviews:   * If you like the feel of a big, heavy vehicle and you have the need to transport hordes of kids plus the camper trailer to put them in, the 2012 Chevy Tahoe SUV makes a great choice. Not as long (or expensive) as a Suburban, the Tahoe's smaller size makes it a bit easier to park, and its E85-compatible V8 engine gives greater flexibility come fill-up time.

Looking to make a deal so this car must go!  Up for grabs is my 2013 VW Jetta in black on black  This has been an awesome car to own but I'm looking to sell this car ASAP as I'm buying a new car and want to liquidate. This 5 cylinder has no turbo lag like the newer ones do, so it spools up nicely but also gets pretty good gas mileage looking at around 30-32mpg on a good day.  Interior is in absolutely phenomenal shape with no rips tears or damage to the seats or dash. Exterior however does have dings that just happen from years of ownership. Must see in person  Looks pretty phenomenal for a 2013 and only has an average amount of miles.  The car is rebuilt and was in an accident with less than 500 miles and was repaired from front end damage but nothing bad. Steering is a little heavier but still turns well and smoothly with no noise. Just had AC recharged so it blows cold (SUPER cold!). Also just has brand new battery installed with 6 months warranty no matter what happens to it.  Headliner was also changed w 3 year warranty  Must see in person as it runs and drives great. just want a bigger car for filming.",fl,25.7479,-80.2695

I bought this as a certified pre-owned truck and the remainder of the CPO warranty is transferable to the next owner.    This Tacoma is in excellent shape. It has never been smoked in. Finding one of these with a manual transmission is hard to do. They only made the 3rd generation 4 cylinder Tacoma with a manual transmission for two model years (2016 & 2017).  This is the SR trim Tacoma with the convenience package and upgraded wheels. It has heated/power mirrors and power door locks.  It also has bluetooth and a backup camera. It has the tow package and a bedliner as well. This one also has color matched front and rear bumpers. Most of these have black bumpers, no sliding rear window, or rear jump seats. I am the 2nd owner of this truck. I purchased it in July of 2019. The first owner had it through a lease. There have been no accidents or damage of any kind to the truck.   This would make a very nice truck for someone who is wanting one that will last a long time. Toyota has put these 2.7 liter 4 cylinder engines in Tacomas since 2004. They are very reliable and for a 4 cylinder engine, they make quite a bit of torque. This truck also gets great gas mileage for a 4x4 pickup. I've consistently gotten around 22/23 mpg. I am NOT a dealer so you don't have to worry about doc fees and other ridiculous fees that dealerships like to add to the price. For more info please contact me.  SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! PHONE CALLS ONLY, NO TEXTS! I DO NOT NEED HELP SELLING! THANK YOU!",tn,36.2569,-82.6905

This car drives amazing and starts right up and everything works, it has been WELL taken care of, I've driven many of these cars and this one rides and drives light years ahead of the others, its a real joy to cruise in.  It is a 5.0 Automatic car, with Air conditioning and new convertible top, tires and wheels.  Body and interior are in great shape for their age but are not brand new, but certainly a car you can be proud to own.  We take great pride in selling the best vehicles around and it shows on our lot. Sadly most dealers just run a vehicle through a carwash, vacuum it and spray tire shine all over, then you get to be the unlucky person to buy a vehicle that needs work....when was the last time you traded in a vehicle that didn't need some attention!!!! Don't buy from a tire shine dealer, buy from a place that cares and has pride. Shop other places first then come see our difference, and be sure to ask the dealer for proof that his vehicle has been checked out and good to go and how many miles he has personally driven it, I drive every vehicle on my lot!

Black 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT 4D Crew Cab EcoTec3 5.3L V8 4WD  Odometer is 2802 miles below market average! Reviews:   * Powerful, fuel-efficient engines; many available configurations; well-built, comfortable interior; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * If you don't already like the 2015 Silverado for the mere fact that it's a Chevy, this pickup makes a compelling case for itself with a sophisticated yet intuitive infotainment system, refined interior and an available V8 engine with class-leading power output. Source: KBB.com   * The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. Also, its tough persona is further accentuated by the geometric lines of its new sculpted fenders and dual power dome hood. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color touchscreen. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.

He has a 2-hour+ round trip commute per day so most of the miles are highway.   The car started having an intermittent problem - possible water pump or head gasket. Rather than swapping out parts, he bought my niece's car. This Civic always starts right up. The 4-speed manual transmission gets great gas mileage - 38-40 mpg. When driven locally, the issue has not resurfaced.  In 1993, I bought a new Honda Civic. I drove it for 10 years and put 260,000 miles on it. In 2003, my husband and I bought a new Honda Civic and sold the '93 Civic to my nephew for $1000. He drove it another four years and parted it out for $750. In 2013, we bought a new Honda Civic and sold the '03 to my son for $1000. After racking up 350,000 miles on it, my son sold it for $1000. You can't beat the economy, reliability, and resale value of a Honda Civic.  In 2016, my son bought this 2005 Civic with a salvage title. Until very recently, he's had no issues with the car other than a minor fender bender. While waiting a stop sign in a parking lot, a woman hit the front passenger quarter panel of the Civic. We think she was texting while driving across the parking lot. The cosmetic damage did not affect the car's performance so he did not have it repaired.
