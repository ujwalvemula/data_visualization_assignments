Every leak was chased down and fixed along with  every rust spot being fixed.  All the money invested was not because it was a bad truck, it was all to make it look good.  Bought it in 2011 with 20,000 miles and now it has 69,000 miles.  Clean title.

Reviews:   * New, more fuel-efficient engines; improved interior; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * While we realize the majority of full-size truck buyers are predisposed towards their favorite brand, the 2014 Chevy Silverado makes a compelling case for itself. From its sophisticated-yet-easy-to-use infotainment system to its surprisingly refined interior, the 2014 Silverado deserves serious consideration from the brand faithful and cross-shoppers alike. Source: KBB.com   * On the outside, the 2014 Silverado looks like the truck you have come to know and trust. In reality, it is all-new from the ground up and more than ready to take on your toughest jobs to show what it can do. The body has undergone a modern makeover making it more chiseled and sleek at the same time. The most dramatic part is the huge stacked double grille in front, complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, all outlined in chrome. The bumper has been contoured as well. Also, its tough persona is further accentuated by the geometric lines of its new sculpted fenders and dual power dome hood. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado has new impressive engines for 2014. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V-6, with 6-speed automatic transmission. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V-8, which is also an option for the other trims. Major improvements have been made inside as well. It is much quieter and roomier than before, and has high quality materials. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Plus, the seats have been redesigned to keep you more comfortable throughout the day. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to , 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT    Equipment & Feature List:   Lt Convenience PackageLt Plus PackageTrailering Equipment6 Speaker Audio System6 SpeakersAm/Fm Radio: SiriusxmCd PlayerMp3 DecoderPremium Audio System: Chevrolet MylinkRadio Data SystemRadio: Am/Fm 8 Diagonal Color Touch ScreenRadio: Am/Fm Audio System W/Chevrolet MylinkSingle Slot Cd/Mp3 PlayerSiriusxm Satellite & Hd RadioSteering Wheel Audio ControlsAir ConditioningDual-Zone Automatic Climate ControlElectric Rear-Window Defogger110-Volt Ac Power OutletBluetooth For PhonePower Sliding Rear WindowPower SteeringPower WindowsPower Windows W/Driver Express UpRemote Keyless EntryRemote Keyless EntryRemote Vehicle Starter SystemSteering Wheel Mounted Audio ControlsUniversal Home RemoteLeather Wrapped Steering Wheel W/Cruise ControlsManual Tilt Wheel Steering ColumnManual Tilt/Telescoping Steering ColumnSpeed-Sensing SteeringTraction Control4-Wheel Disc BrakesAbs BrakesDual Front Impact AirbagsDual Front Side Impact AirbagsEmergency Communication SystemFront Anti-Roll BarFront Wheel Independent SuspensionLow Tire Pressure WarningOccupant Sensing AirbagOverhead AirbagRear Chrome BumperBrake AssistElectronic Stability ControlUltrasonic Rear Park AssistDelay-Off HeadlightsFront Halogen Fog LampsFully Automatic HeadlightsPanic AlarmTheft Deterrent System (Unauthorized Entry)Speed ControlHeavy-Duty Rear Locking Differential150 Amp AlternatorAuxiliary External Transmission Oil CoolerBlack Power Adjustable Heated Outside MirrorsBumpers: ChromeEz Lift & Lower TailgateFront Chrome BumperHeated Door MirrorsLed Cargo Box LightingPolished Exhaust TipPower Door MirrorsRear Step BumperRear Wheelhouse Liners4.2 Diagonal Color Display Driver Info CenterCloth Seat TrimColor-Keyed Carpeting W/Rubberized Vinyl Floor MatsCompassDriver & Front Passenger Illuminated Vanity MirrorsDriver Door BinDriver Vanity MirrorFront & Rear All-Weather Floor Mats (Lpo) (Disc)Front Reading LightsIlluminated EntryOnstar 6 Months Directions & Connections PlanOutside Temperature DisplayOverhead ConsolePassenger Vanity MirrorPower Adjustable PedalsRear Reading LightsRear Seat Center ArmrestRear Vision Camera W/Dynamic Guide LinesTachometerTilt Steering WheelTrip ComputerVoltmeter10-Way Power Driver's Seat Adjuster40/20/40 Front Split Bench SeatRear 60/40 Folding Bench Seat (Folds Up)Split Folding Rear SeatFront Center Armrest W/StoragePassenger Door BinFront Frame-Mounted Black Recovery HooksAlloy WheelsWheels: 20 X 9 Polished-AluminumDeep-Tinted GlassVariably Intermittent Wipers3.42 Rear Axle Ratio**Lifetime Engine And Transmission Warranty**** Voted Best In Bartlesville **** Alloy Wheels** Lt Package     This Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is offered by:  Patriot Chevrolet      3800 SE Adams Rd  Bartlesville, OK 74006      Phone: (316) 854-4102 ext: 0254    DISCLAIMER:   While every reasonable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the information for this *Chevrolet Silverado 1500*, we are not responsible for any errors or omissions contained on these pages.

Iâm the second owner of truck it. It has 209k on motor and has been a good running truck until recently. It started running rough so I took it to my mechanic and he did a diagnostic test showing misfire on the 3rd and 5th cylinder. He pulled plugs and replaced both as they were burning rich. It made no difference. Cap and rotor were changed and fuel system pressure tested and functioned properly. I bought and replaced computer for truck and still have issue. Truck turns over and spits and sputters but WILL NOT FIRE. The mechanic believes it spider injection system as this can fail over time. The rest of the truck is mechanically sound with the exception of e brake cable  needing replacement. Tires are  fire stone Destination A/T with appx 50% tread left. There is rust at cab corners ect. As you would expect from a 20+ truck. $1000 FIRM AND NO TRADES. Cash only...Thanks,ny,42.1874,-75.8657

It has a decent amount of body damage mostly on the right side and front end.  The front end damage came from hitting a deer a couple years ago and I was getting a new truck anyway so I just let it sit.  The dash is pretty busted up and the center console has some damage from resting my elbow on it.  Also the drivers side seat had a couple small rips but besides that the interior is still in pretty good shape.  The rear tires are pretty bald so will need to be replace.  Recently charged the battery enough to get all the lights to come on and ignition with try to start but won't turn over.  When it was last running it ran great.
